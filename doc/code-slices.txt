This plugin is developed because I feel the need of collect 'slices' of code
to reuse them on across a single or multiple projects in a way that results
easy, intuitive, fast and even fun. So you can think about this plugin as a
copy-paste on esteroids

2. Usage						     *code-slices-usage*

When finishing writing a fragment of code and you know you will use it again
soon or later, it's adviced to save that fragment in a slice. the
|code-slices| plugin provides a command to do it. To create the slice, just
select in visual mode the lines you want to keep and execute the command
|CreateSlice| You can specify a slice name when executing the command or if is
not provided, the plugin ask you for a name whicha can be empty. For example,
selecting in visual mode the following lines: >
    if !isdir('slices')
	return 1
    endif
<

and then executing the command >
    :CreateSlice if is dir
<

Will result in the following lines in the related slices file: >

 Group pending
 Slice if is dir
 if !isdir('slices')
     return 1
 endif
<

The slices file will be stored inside a configutable directory and it's name
is given by the file type you are editing and the extension |.slices| which in
turn is stored inside a directory named |slices| which in turn is stored in a
a configurable path given by the variable |g:slices_preferred_path| for
example, when editing a |.vim| file if you create a slice, it will be appended
to the file |vim.slices| in a path like the following: >

 $HOME
 |- slices
 | `- vim.slices
<

After adding a slice you can see it inside the slide collection when you
execute the |ShowSlices| command.

3. commands						*code-slices-commands*

							*ShowSlices*

Shows the previously created slices in the slices window. For the filetype of
the current file or for the file type you specify as parameter

							*ShowSlicesGroup*

Shows previously created slices in the slices window and jumps to the group
passed as argument

							*CreateSlice*

Creates a new slice with the current line or with the visual selected lines
For the file type of the current buffer

CreateFluentSlice					*CreateFluentSlice*

Like |CreateSlice| but create a Fluent Slice which is a slice that can be
inserted line by line

							*EditSlicesFile*

This command opens for edition the slices file for the filetype in the current
buffer

4. Writing and editting Slices				*writing-slices*

The syntax of a slice files Is very simple It is just |Groups| and |Slices| to
define a group you start a line with the the word Group with no spaces before
it and, to define a slice you just have to start the line with the word Slice.
Both types of definition supports adding text after it. For groups the text
after the keyword |Group| is the name of the group that used to locate the
group when using the command |ShowSlicesGroup|; for the slices, the text after
the keyword is used just to give you a hint about what that slices do.

Slices created with the |CreateSlice| and |CreateFluentSlice| commands are
automatically added to the group 'pending' which is created if not exists;
however this probably is not what you want or need and in this case you need
to manually edit the slices file. You can edit the file either by directly
open the file in vim or by using the |EditSlicesFile| . The slices file will
then appear with syntax higlight of the filetype it represents and with syntax
higlight for lines beggining with the words |Slice| , |FluentSlice| and
|Group| which represents the parts of a slices file

If you want to create slices by hand, you should add them to the corresponding
slices file. The slices file is located inside the |slices| directory inside
the path |g:slices_preferred_path| I.E if you set the variable as: >

  let g:slices_preferred_path = expand('$HOME') . '/myslices'
<

The slices file for the python filetype will be located at: >

  ~/myslices/slices/python.slices

The structure of the slices file is very simple. It is organized in Groups and
Groups contains slices. A slice is contained in the first group matched going
from the position of the slice to the top. I.E to add a simple python
slice to the group default python you add the following lines to the slices
file: >

 Group default python
 Slice ternary
 'success' if true else 'failure'
<
To ease the visual scanning of the slices you can use a (by default) 2 space
indentation. I.E. >

 Group default python
 Slice ternary
   'success' if true else 'failure'
<
Remember that the special words |Group| , |Slice| and |FluentSlice| always
starts in the first column with no spaces before.

The plugin support a special type of slices which just insert one line at time
when hitting the |<CR>| key in the slices windows these slices are called fluent
slices and inside the slices file, these slices are defined almost with the
same syntax as the regular slices but with the keyword |FluentSlice| instead
of |Slice| I.E. >

 Group django
 FluentSlice from django
 from django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied
 from django.http import Http404
 from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseNotFound
 from django.shortcuts import render_to_response
<
When you start the insertion of this slice from the slices window, slice is
inserted line bt line |<CR>| key so you can skip the lines you don't need And
the slices windows automatically closes when you insert the last line of the
slice

5. Slices window mappings

After executing the command |ShowSlices| the slices windows is shown and it
obtains the cursor to let you insert the slices in your working buffer. When
the slices window is created, the plugin creates the following mapping:

|<Tab>|		To let you moving to the next slice
|<BS>|		To let you moving to the previous slice
|<CR>|		To insert the current slice and close the slices window
|<Space>|	To insert the current slice and stay in the slices window

The |<Tab>| and |<BS>| support counts to move faster between slices; the |<CR>| 
and |<Space>| Support counts when you are inserting a FluentSlice
